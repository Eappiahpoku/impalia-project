Main Sections:
a. Who We Are

We are Project Impalia, a group of 20 SOS-HGIC students, whose objective as a team is to find ways to raise funds to not only help solve different issues that come with poverty, but also spread awareness while doing so.

We plan on doing multiple fundraisers and events to raise money for our plans such as a soup kitchen, the donation of clothes, cleaning supplies, groceries, etc.

Focusing on homelessness as a whole is helping us kill two birds with one stone. We aim to help multiple social issues with the intent of benefiting a bigger cause — poverty.
b. Why Impalia

The name is derived from the Impala Lily, a rare flower that blooms in dry, harsh lands. This flower is the national flower of Ghana and perfectly represents everything Ghanaians embody — kindness, spirit, resilience, and warmth.

The Project Impalia team strives to be just like this flower. We want our impact to thrive despite challenges and grow, inspire, and create lasting change, just like the Impala Lily does against all odds.
