# How to create a CRUD app

1. Create the display in the HomeView.vue using Claude Sonnet 4.0
2. Divide the display into micro components and export them unto the HomeView.vue
3. We generate mock/static data as placeholder text for our project
4. We tell GTP4.1 to use our mock/static data.
5. We work on the Add Subject button to ensure that the Flashcards can be made.
6. We add Edit and Delete buttons
7. The rest are touch ups
